      <p>
        Besides my career of being a web developer, I am also a father, and I
        really enjoy spending time with my daughter, Marcella, and my wife,
        Maddie. There's also some time in there for romping around with my two
        large dogs, Banjo and Harley.
      </p>

        When not spending time with my family, I love playing tabletop games and
        D&D with friends. This hobby kind of bled into my other interests in 3D
        printing where I seem to print far more miniatures than I can possibly
        paint.

        Apart from being a father & super nerd I am also an avid runner. Last
        year after training for 16 weeks, I ran my first full marathon for the
        Seattle Rock n Roll marathon in 2019 and plan on running it again
        someday!
