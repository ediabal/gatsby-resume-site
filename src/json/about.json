    "Currently, I am working as a remote full-stack web developer building the Muse Design System component library for FireEye, Inc.",
    "I started my career in web development in 2014 when I got my first real taste of building web applications for the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division (NSWCDD), a real mouthful, I know. After finishing what looked liked my last web application contract there I decided it was time to make the move to the private sector.",
    "Not long afterwards, I began working for FireEye, Inc. on their customer facing security platform portal and it was very cool! FireEye has been extremely beneficial to my personal development and growth as they have facilitated my interests and continued learning. They've also given me the freedom to work remotely on many different projects and teams thus allowing me to learn many new technologies along the way.",
    "For the past few years I've been heavily involved in designing and implementing front-end solutions in technologies such as React.js, Ruby on Rails and, most recently, Web Components. I continue to be very interested in web application development and learning new technologies and frameworks.",
    "Welcome and thank you for visiting this page!"
